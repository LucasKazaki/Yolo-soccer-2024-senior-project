# ‚öΩ Yolo Soccer: Real-Time Player Tracking and Visualization with YOLOv8

Welcome to my senior research project! This Python-based project was the culmination of months of interdisciplinary work combining computer vision, machine learning, and my deep love for sports and technology. I developed it during my senior year at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST) as part of my capstone experience.

## üìñ About the Project

**Yolo Soccer** uses the YOLOv8 object detection model to:
- Detect soccer players in real-time footage.
- Track player positions on a bird‚Äôs-eye view of the soccer field.
- Classify players into teams based on jersey color.
- Generate heatmaps showing player density over time.

This project has potential applications in:
- Automated sports analytics.
- Player tracking for training and strategy.
- Enriching viewer experience in broadcasts.

## üí° My Journey

As a CS student passionate about machine learning and computer vision, I wanted a project that pushed the limits of what I could do with deep learning frameworks. I started by experimenting with basic YOLOv8 models and gradually incorporated OpenCV, Matplotlib, and other libraries to create a full pipeline from detection to visualization.

I took inspiration from broadcast-level sports tracking systems and wanted to build a low-cost, accessible alternative that students and hobbyists could use. This project was deeply meaningful to me‚Äîit sharpened my skills, gave me hands-on experience with real-world challenges, and confirmed my commitment to studying machine learning and AI at the University of Maryland.

## üöÄ How It Works

The script does the following:
1. Loads a video of a soccer game and initializes the YOLOv8 model.
2. Asks the user to:
   - Select the corners of the field for perspective warping.
   - Identify field color bounds.
   - Select jersey colors of both teams.
3. Uses YOLOv8 to detect players in overlapping patches.
4. Transforms player positions into a bird‚Äôs-eye view using a perspective matrix.
5. Classifies players by jersey color using simple color-distance metrics.
6. Displays:
   - A live frame with bounding boxes.
   - A live bird‚Äôs-eye field with player positions.
   - A real-time heatmap of player positions.
7. Outputs a side-by-side video and saves a heatmap.

## üì¶ Dependencies

Install required packages with:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless ultralytics matplotlib pillow scipy keyboard numpy
```

## üìÇ Input

- A sample video file path should be specified in the `filename` variable (`.MP4` format). (Ex. files here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v4c_Z-YZUsfC4u7KFTjWYzjPg3CZwkyr?usp=sharing)
- A reference image of a soccer field (`Soccer_field.png`) for the bird‚Äôs-eye overlay.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python "Yolo soccer thingy.py"
```

### Controls:
- Use mouse clicks to define field and jersey regions.
- Press `Enter` after selecting the green field area.
- Press `S` to save the current video frame.
- Press `Q` to quit and save the video and heatmap.

The program will produce:
- `output.mp4`: A side-by-side video showing the original footage and bird‚Äôs-eye tracking.
- `heatmap.png`: A colorized heatmap image of player movement.

## üß† Technical Highlights

- **YOLOv8 (via Ultralytics)**: For real-time player detection.
- **OpenCV**: For image manipulation, warping, and GUI interactions.
- **Matplotlib 3D Scatter Plotting**: For live jersey color analysis.
- **Heatmap Aggregation**: Based on field-warped player positions.
